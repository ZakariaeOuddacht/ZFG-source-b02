  I. If You Have The Source Code Downloaded and Godot 3.5.3 has It, Create a Folder in The Project Called "Tqdq old lemons" And Put All The Official Levels from "BubblesToPlay" Folder
  
  II. Right Click On "Spacetoon.tscn" (WHAT THE HELL) and Choose "Create an Inherited Scene" or whenever this is, Then Make Your Level and Save it into "BubblesToPlay"
  
  III. Don't Delete Unused Files
  
  IV. If You Finish The Game Hack, Give Me The Source Code of The Game Hack and The Game's .exe itself, so I can verify it.
